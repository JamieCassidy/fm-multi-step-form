## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)


### What I learned

This was a really good excercise to improve my React knowledge. I feel like I've learnt a lot since starting this challenge and would definitely feel more comfortable building react apps going forward. I put a lot of effort into accurately re-creating the designs in the browser which was a real test of my HTML and CSS knowledge.


### Continued development

One thing I'd like to improve on is managing the state better using React contexts or a third part state management library. It's absolutely not essential for this project given it's size but I'd like to get to grips with how they work for larger more complex applications.
